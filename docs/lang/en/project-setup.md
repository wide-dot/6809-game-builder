# Setup a new game project
## Usage

To create a new game project, you have to use the following command :

`gamebuilder -e /mydir/newproject`

It will create a new directory called "newproject" and unpack all engine files in the engine subdirectory.

As a security, nothing will happen if the directory already exists. This prevents file overwriting on an existing project.
